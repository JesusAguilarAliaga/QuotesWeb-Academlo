# Quotes from Space Web

This project is an exercise from the Academlo module. I've made several enhancements to create a more appealing structure, but I'm not quite happy with the font yet! üòÑ

Implemented features:
- Get random elements
- Prevent the display of repeated elements
- Generate a quote
- Display an author
- Create a button to change the quote and wallpaper (with a slight animation)
